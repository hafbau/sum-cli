Dev Workflow with Hafiz
===

Hey folks, thanks for sitting through that today. I like your questions, please keep them coming. I hope you had fun, you could tell I did. I also apologize for going overtime.

[Here's a link to the code we wrote in class](https://github.com/hafbau/sum-cli)

Here's a link to [Travis's (another Instructor) note](https://github.com/tborsa/lectures/blob/master/week1/day2/notes.md) I mentioned in class. This note goes through a bunch of stuffs we talked about in class. It also has some resources to pay attention to; for instance pythontutor.com for visualizing how your code runs.

I also recorded the videos; [here is the link to it on YouTube.](https://youtu.be/tr_SguKMwCI)

Thanks till next time.
