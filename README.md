# Sum CLI

## Problem:
Write a node program that takes in an unlimited number of command line arguments, goes through each and prints out the sum of them. If any argument is not a whole number, skip it. Do support negative numbers though.

**Read Evaluate Print Loop** - basically a shell where you could explore javascript.
We got there using the `node` command without an argument.
